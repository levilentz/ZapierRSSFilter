# ZapierRSSFilter

This repo tracks code for creating a quick little filter for an RSS feed. It was purpose built for my Wife's website ([Science of Connectedness](https://scienceofconnectedness.com)) so that she could quickly filter an RSS feed that she built on [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/rss/help). 

While the Zapier RSS feed is very cool, it does a couple things that are bothersome:

1. It puts links back to Zapier in the RSS feed. 
2. Filtering is only by the number, with no ability to filter by date. 
3. Generally, there is an inflexibility to customize the feed. 

This code is a nice jumping off point, letting tools such as Zapier manage the RSS feed source, while tools such as this can add functionality and enable more robust customization of the feed.
